# Unlinked from Atmosphere

I no longer use any of these and won't be making any updates. 
Also, FlowRouter is busy growing its API and I expect they'll make a "helpers"
package soon.

# Path Helpers for [FlowRouter](https://github.com/meteorhacks/flow-router) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elidoran/cosmos-flow-router-path-helpers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elidoran/cosmos-flow-router-path-helpers)

Implements [cosmos:path-helpers](http://github.com/elidoran/cosmos-path-helpers) with `FlowRouter.path` to generate the paths.

Provides path helpers to [FlowRouter](https://github.com/meteorhacks/flow-router) which are commonly used with [Iron Router](https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-router)

Helpers:

1. pathFor

2. urlFor

3. linkTo

4. isPath / isPathNot

See base package [cosmos:path-helpers](http://github.com/elidoran/cosmos-path-helpers) for more detailed info.


## Install

```
meteor add cosmos:flow-router-path-helpers
